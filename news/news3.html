            <h1>Porsche and Michelin support Indonesian rubber plantation farmers</h1>
            <h2>Porsche and Michelin are championing the sustainable extraction of natural rubber. The commitment of the
                sports car manufacturer and the tyre producer to transparency and better working conditions in the
                extraction of raw materials is demonstrated by the CASCADE (Committed Actions for Smallholders Capacity
                Development) project. </h2>

                For Porsche, responsibility begins a long way from the factory gates. We take a holistic approach to
                sustainability. Our supply chain and the extraction of raw materials are important factors here,” says
                Barbara Frenkel, Member of the Executive Board for Procurement at Porsche AG. “We take responsibility
                for our impact on the rubber extraction regions in Indonesia. We want to improve people’s lives through
                projects conducted in the area. Smallholders form the heart of a sustainable supply chain for natural
                rubber. That's why we are supporting them to achieve a decent standard of living while adhering to good
                environmental and social practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Long-term partners Porsche and Michelin are supporting Sumatran small plantation farmers in the
                extraction of rubber. Education and training on cultivation practices, biodiversity and work safety all
                have the aim of achieving long-term improvements in the living conditions and economic situations of the
                Indonesian smallholders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indonesia is one of the world’s most important rubber production regions and includes the rural Jambi
                province. Porsche and Michelin identified risks to the sustainability of the supply chain in rubber
                extraction using an app specially developed for this purpose and by conducting discussions with market
                participants in the area. Rubber is used in a great many industrial products as a raw material. As an
                automotive manufacturer, Porsche also contributes to global rubber consumption through its tyres as well
                as in a wide range of vehicle parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                “CASCADE is an example of Michelin’s commitment to a sustainable natural rubber supply chain that
                protects the environment and improves livelihoods. We are happy to be working with Porsche on this
                ambitious project. For almost 20 years, we have enjoyed a close partnership in the tyre business, which
                we are now also expanding to the area of sustainability,” says Hélène Paul, Senior Vice President, Chief
                Procurement Officer at Michelin.
            </p>
            <p>
                CASCADE is one of the first support projects in the world to start at the lowest level of the natural
                rubber supply chain. The scheme will see 1,000 smallholders trained by local partners to make extraction
                methods more environmentally compatible and efficient. This makes a considerable contribution to the
                lasting improvement of living conditions of smallholders and their families. Porsche and Michelin are
                investing around one million euros in the project, which will initially run until 2024.
