            <h1>Porsche 962 C restored to its original condition down to the last detail</h1>
            <h2>Hans-Joachim Stuck has had to wait almost 35 years for a reunion with the fully refurbished 962 C and
                its first rollout. So the surprise was all the greater when the silk cloth was drawn back to reveal the
                vehicle at the Weissach Development Centre.</h2>

                The racing car from the Porsche Heritage and Museum department has been restored to its original 1987
                condition over the past year and a half. “It feels like coming home,” smiles Stuck, stroking the car’s
                left wing. The racing driver says he has nothing but fond memories of the victorious car with the racing
                number 17. “By arranging this reunion after more than three decades, we have not only surprised
                Hans-Joachim Stuck, we have also taken a little journey through time. The history of the motorsport
                story surrounding the 962 C is unique,” says Achim Stejskal, Head of Porsche Heritage and Museum.

                At the Weissach Development Centre, where the vehicle was first built and now has been restored to its
                original condition, Stuck also meets his race engineer of the time, Norbert Singer, and designer Rob
                Powell, the man responsible for the car’s black, yellow and red livery.

                It is 35 years since the now 70-year-old won Germany’s prestigious and fiercely contested ADAC Würth
                Supercup. During the inaugural series for Group C sports car prototypes, he tested the then-new Porsche
                dual clutch transmission (PDK) at racing speed. The vehicle’s appearance changed before the second race,
                the Norisring 200 miles, when Shell came on board as a sponsor
            </p>

                Porsche also competed in yellow and red the following year and Stuck worked hard to successfully defend
                his Supercup title. This 962 C then began its second life as a test car in the aerodynamics department
                at Weissach, later serving as a reference vehicle for the sports car manufacturer’s corporate
                collection.

                Armin Burger and Traugott Brecht from Historic Motorsport were jointly responsible for the racing car’s
                rebuild. “We kept passing this car in the warehouse. Then, about a year and a half ago, we decided to
                get it out of there, transfer it to Weissach and start working on it,” he Burger. He and his team had to
                rebuild many parts because they were long gone. “The cooperation with the other departments from Porsche
                was great. We found almost everything we needed within a radius of just 30 metres,” says Burger.
