            <h1>Rear bicycle carrier for the Taycan Cross Turismo: a weighty idea</h1>
            <h2>The Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo is made for travel and adventures. That’s why Porsche decided not to
                design a heavy trailer hitch for it. Even so, the sturdiest of bikes and e-bikes can still be easily
                transported.</h2>

                The exceptionally low positioning of the Porsche Tequipment rear bicycle carrier minimises aerodynamic
                drag, which benefits the car’s range. The assembly concept is very simple: remove two small panels from
                the rear apron, push in the support tubes and turn them 45 degrees. The carrier can then be put in place
                and unfolded in three steps. It’s simple – and it’s safe, too, because each step locks the previous one.
                If each action is not completed, the process cannot be continued. ‘Poka-yoke’ – a Japanese term – is
                what engineers call this fault-eliminating principle. Porsche also applies it to vehicle assembly.

                The engineers at Porsche have devised a rear carrier solution and have already applied for a patent for
                the way it directly connects to the longitudinal profiles of the body construction. This unique type of
                assembly leads to outstanding stability, which Porsche tested as part of the overall vehicle test
                programme of the Taycan Cross Turismo, including high-speed trials at Nardò.

                The spacers enable perfect mounting of all frame geometries, and the limited clamping force of the
                brackets also protects more delicate carbon frames. The boot remains accessible when the carrier is
                mounted, and the carrier can be folded away – elegantly and gently, as it is hydraulically damped.
