            <p>
                Following the season finale of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, André Lotterer is resting up at
                home in Monaco before a training camp with teammates. The three-time Le Mans winner and star of both the
                World Endurance Championship and Japan’s Super GT series has been driving for Porsche in its second
                season in the all-electric single seater series, bringing a wealth of experience and expert race craft
                to a new team in an unfamiliar discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lotterer joined the Porsche family in 2017 when he won a seat in the 919 Hybrid for that year’s WEC. But
                his passion for the brand goes back many years, and the 39-year-old has an impressive collection of
                classic and modern Porsche models that he drives whenever possible. Born in Germany, and raised in
                Belgium, Lotterer found this particular Sunday Drive route by chance when viewing what was to become his
                holiday home near Luberon. It takes in some of the most spectacular scenery in the south of France and
                in early summer is made unforgettable by the extraordinary lavender fields that are a trademark of the
                region.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The roads out of Monaco into the countryside behind are all really steep and full of hairpins,”
                Lotterer says, “so the best thing to do is drive down to Nice and then head up to Fréjus. There are lots
                of beautiful country roads you can choose, but your destination should be the Gorge du Verdon, which is
                famous for its super-blue water. I did the drive for the first time last year and was amazed by how
                beautiful it is.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Lotterer’s route takes him from the town of Fréjus on the coast on a relaxed 90-minute drive to the
                700-metre-deep gorge, from where he recommends taking one of the minor roads that fringe its 25
                kilometre length for some spectacular views over the gorge towards the Sainte-Croix lake. From here,
                head west on the D952 and D6 towards Valensole. As a talented amateur photographer in his spare time,
                this section offers Lotterer the perfect balance between jaw-dropping scenery and fabulous driving.
            </p>

                When I drove here last year I went straight from Monaco to the Gorge du Verdon and was amazed by how
                beautiful it all becomes – the curves of the road, the variety of the countryside, the scenery and all
                these little villages. There are roads that cut straight between the fields of lavender and you just
                keep going and going. You can drive for half an hour non-stop through this sea of purple. It’s quite a
                special place.
