            <h1>Porsche deliveries up by 13 per cent</h1>
            <h2>Record result for the first three quarters: between January and September 2021, Porsche delivered
                217,198 vehicles worldwide. This represented a 13 per cent increase for the sports car manufacturer.

                Demand rose across all sales regions, with the US again recording particularly strong growth. “The very
                high demand for our sports cars continued into the third quarter and we are delighted to have been able
                to supply so many cars to customers during the first nine months of the year,” says Detlev von Platen,
                Member of the Executive Board for Sales and Marketing at Porsche AG.

                “The order books are nicely filled and are, in turn, filling us with optimism and enthusiasm as we
                approach the year-end rush. However, the coronavirus situation remains dynamic and we are facing
                challenges in sourcing semiconductors. For these reasons, we are keeping a very close eye on current
                developments to ensure that we can continue to react in a flexible manner.”

                The Porsche Cayenne remains the most successful model, with 62,451 examples delivered, followed by the
                Macan with 61,944 units, a 12 per cent increase. The fully electric Taycan was also extremely popular,
                with 28,640 cars being delivered to customers. Now in its second full year on the market, it is on a par
                with the iconic 911 sports car, 27,972 of which were delivered in the first three quarters – an increase
                of ten per cent. The 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman were purchased by 15,916 customers, which represents a
                rise of one per cent compared to the same period last year. Deliveries of the Panamera also remained
                firmly at the previous year’s level with 20,275 examples – an increase of one per cent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once again, the largest increase was seen in the US: Porsche delivered 51,615 vehicles there in the
                first nine months, which represents an increase of 30 per cent compared with the same period last year.
            </p>

                The strong positioning in North America is also reflected in the findings of the most recent J.D. Power
                APEAL study: as in previous years, customers still see Porsche as the most appealing premium brand.
                Across the American continent as a whole, Porsche made a total of 63,025 deliveries, 29 per cent more
                than in the first three quarters of 2020.
